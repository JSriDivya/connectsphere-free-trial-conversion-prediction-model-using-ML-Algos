# üß† Predicting Free Trial Conversion for ConnectSphere using different ML Algorithms

This project uses machine learning to predict which new users of the "ConnectSphere" SaaS tool are likely to convert from a free trial to a paid subscription. By analyzing user activity within their **first 7 days**, we can identify high-potential leads for targeted engagement.

## üéØ The Goal

To build a reliable model that helps the sales and marketing teams focus their efforts, improve the trial-to-paid conversion rate, and increase revenue.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: A Quick Overview

1.  **Data Simulation:** Creates a realistic dataset of user activities (projects created, team members invited, etc.).
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Checks the data for errors, missing values, and outliers to ensure reliability.
3.  **Model Comparison:** Trains and evaluates several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.) to find the best baseline predictor.
4.  **Analysis & Reporting:** Identifies the key user behaviors that signal a likely conversion and summarizes findings.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.


## üí° Key Findings

-   **Prediction is Feasible:** We can reliably predict user conversion based on early activity. The **Random Forest** model provided the strongest initial performance.
-   **Engagement is Everything:** Users who are most active‚Äîspecifically those who **create projects**, **invite team members**, and **complete the onboarding tutorial**‚Äîare far more likely to become paying customers.

## üìà Recommendations for Stakeholders

Here are simple, actionable steps ConnectSphere can take based on this analysis:

1.  **Create a "Hot List" for Sales:**
    *   **Action:** Use this model to score new users daily. Anyone with a high "likelihood to buy" score should be flagged for proactive outreach from the sales or customer success team.
    *   **Benefit:** Focus your team's valuable time on leads that are already showing strong buying signals.

2.  **Guide Users to Key "Aha!" Moments:**
    *   **Action:** Since creating projects and inviting others are crucial, enhance your welcome emails and in-app tours to guide every new user toward performing these specific actions.
    *   **Benefit:** You actively help more users discover the core value of the tool, making them more likely to subscribe.

3.  **Be Smarter with Marketing Dollars:**
    *   **Action:** Double-down on marketing channels (like Referrals) that consistently bring in users who show high conversion potential according to the model.
    *   **Benefit:** Get a better return on your marketing investment by focusing on what works.

4.  **Tailor Your Communication:**
    *   **Action:** Stop sending the same message to everyone. Segment users by their predicted score and send targeted content‚Äîspecial offers for "hot leads" and helpful guides for those on the fence.
    *   **Benefit:** Increase engagement and conversion by sending more relevant messages.

## üîÆ Next Steps

-   **Fine-Tune the Model:** Improve prediction accuracy by tuning the best model's parameters.
-   **Automate:** Integrate this scoring system into our internal CRM or dashboard for real-time insights.
